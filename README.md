Overview:
Football match outcomes are influenced by numerous factors, such as team performance, player statistics, and external conditions. This project aims to leverage machine learning to accurately predict match results and provide insights into key contributing factors.

Features:
>Predict match outcomes: Win, Lose, or Draw
>Analyze the influence of home-ground advantage
>Evaluate the impact of team performance metrics
>Visualize results with performance metrics and graphs

Technologies Used
>Python: Core programming language
>Scikit-learn: Machine learning library for model implementation
>Pandas: Data manipulation and analysis
>Matplotlib/Seaborn: Data visualization
>Jupyter Notebook: For development and experimentation

Dataset:
The dataset contains historical football match data, including:
>Team statistics
>Match outcomes
>Home/away team identifiers
>Match dates

Usage:
>Preprocess the dataset by running the data preprocessing cells in the notebook.
>Train the Random Forest Classifier using the provided script.
>Use the test dataset to evaluate model accuracy and generate predictions.
>Visualize predictions and performance using built-in plots.

Future Improvements
>Incorporate player-specific performance data
>Test with ensemble models for improved accuracy
>Add real-time prediction features using live match data
>Build a web interface for user-friendly predictions
